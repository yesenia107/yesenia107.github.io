## Favortie CPSC 120L Labs


* Lab 1
   Lab 1 I found this lab fun because it was the first time ever coding, and I was excited to start learning. Also learning how to make a github and a token on github. Also learned how to format. And the partner I worked with helps me understand.


* Lab 7
   This lab was a fun lab, I really enjoyed it. We had to write the code to implement the parking restrictions on the signs. The code determines the parking rules like when you can park. We had to write the code for 4 different streets that all had different parking signs. The partner was assigned to help me when I was stuck on the code.


* Lab 9 part-2
   For this lab I did part 2 and found it really interesting. We had to create different variations of a game. The game was about guessing a secret number. We used an I/O file to make the secret number hidden to the players. I learned how to use the file I/O also declaring and initializing a variable with the std::ofstream. My partner talked to me through the steps because I was a bit confused at first.
